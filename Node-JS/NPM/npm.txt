============= NODE JS - NPM =============

NPM - Node Package Manager
    NPM is really two things:
    1. A library with thousands of packages published by other developers that we can use for free!
    2. A command line tool to easily install and manage those packages in out Node projects.


Familiar Packages:
- react
- express


==> Modules & NPM <==

==> Install <==
> cd /Users/miaevans/IdeaProjects/web-dev-bootcamp
