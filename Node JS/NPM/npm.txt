============= NODE JS - NPM =============

NPM - Node Package Manager
    NPM is really two things:
    1. A library with thousands of packages published by other developers that we can use for free!
    2. A command line tool to easily install and manage those packages in out Node projects.


Familiar Packages:
- react
- express


==> Modules & NPM <==
- NPM: Node Package Manager
- Express: A Node Package installed using npm


==> Install Example <==
> cd /Users/miaevans/IdeaProjects/web-dev-bootcamp/Node-JS/NPM/
> mkdir Jokster
> cd Jokester
> npm install give-me-a-joke
    + node_modules              dependencies
    + package.json              (error: no package.json)
    + package-lock.json         a record of the contents of that node_modules directory
> touch index.js
    + require package
      const jokes = require("give-me-a-joke");
    + verify
      condole.dir(jokes);
> node index.js
> npm i colors
> ls node_modules (now you can see a colors package)
