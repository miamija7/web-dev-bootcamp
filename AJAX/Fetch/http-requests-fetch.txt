======= API HTTP REQUESTS - VIA FETCH =======

fetch
- newer http request method in js
- GET by default
- returns a promise

.then()
- .then() a
- actions after fulfilled fetch promise

.catch()
- actions after rejected fetch promise

res
- variable name for a response
- resolves as soon as it can... "premature"
- .then(res => {...})
- here res has an incomplete body... the body is a readable stream
- so we need to res.json()

res.json().then(data => {...})
- res.json() returns a promise
- if promise fulfilled, data holds json



e
- variable name for error
- .catch(e => {...})
