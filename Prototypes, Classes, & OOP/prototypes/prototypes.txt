======= JAVASCRIPT - PROTOTYPES =======


What are Prototypes?
- the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another
- push() is NOT a method, but a prototype
- property that references the array prototype
- prototype is the template object for a data type
- provides methods for all of that datatype
- not defined on every array that we make, it is defined on the prototype object
- PROTOTYPES ARE A TEMPLATE OBJECT

    [1,2,3].push(4);

    (3) [1, 2, 3, sing: f]
        > sing: f ()
        > __proto__: Array (0)

    NOTE: Proto can also be called "dunder" (double under)


Prototype vs __proto__:
- __proto__ is a reference to the object prototype
- .prototype is the actual prototype object we can add on to
